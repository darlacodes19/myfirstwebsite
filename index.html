    <h2> <a href="pages/aboutme.html"> About Me </a> </h2>
    <p> I'm 26 years old and I was born and raised in Boston, Massachusetts. My family, however, is from the Dominican Republic and I travel there often.</p>

    <p> I have a bachelors degree in Psychology and most of my experiene has been in the healthcare field. I worked as a Behavioral Health Therapist for a while, but quickly realized it wasn't for me. Besides that, I also worked as a Patient Service Represenative and a Patient Coordinator. I decided to start this endeavor because I wanted a career that was more focused on problem-solving and one that allowed me growth and flexibility. I know the tech field is an industry with a lot of opportunities and I'm excided to see where this journey takes me!</p>
    <p> I love traveling and before the pandemic, I got to visit many cool places, like:  Mexico, Aruba, Jamaica, and the Bahamas. My favoite thing about traveling is gaining new experiences and learning about different cultures.</p>
